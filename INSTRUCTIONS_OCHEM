This directory contains scripts to start main ochem server, 
calculation servers as well as configurations of tomcats.

Steps for Linux (ubuntu 22.04 was tested): 

0) Pre-requisites:

Install mariadb and mongodb on your local computer
mongodb does not need any password
mariadb - have password with you to install tables
Additions: if you run VirtualBox, consider installing tools 
https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-virtualbox-guest-additions-in-ubuntu/

install mongodb and mariadb

1) setup directories: in the root of these instructions create links and make scripts executable

export ROOT_DIR=`pwd` 
bash setup.sh

2) install mongodb 4.4 (5.0 is not supported yet) and mariadb (10.6.7+) on your computer, see e.g.

https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v4.4/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/
https://computingforgeeks.com/how-to-install-mariadb-on-ubuntu-lts-linux/

If you are installing MongoDB on Ubuntu 22.04, the following fix might be required:

https://askubuntu.com/questions/1403619/mongodb-install-fails-on-ubuntu-22-04-depends-on-libssl1-1-but-it-is-not-insta

To allow connections outside of local host specify in /etc/mongod.conf :

# network interfaces
net:
  port: 27017
  #bindIp: 127.0.0.1
  bindIpAll: true 

2) in demo-data folder: create tables in mariadb from this directory (root mysql password could be required)

cd ${ROOT_DIR}/demo-data
sudo bash
bash insert_databases.sh 

3) Download optimal modules as indicated in the respective directories for
mold2

4) in singularity folder: compile singularity image

First install singularity: see instructions at https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/blob/main/INSTALL.md

cd ${ROOT_DIR}/demo-data
sudo singularity build ../env/ochemenv/ochemenv.sif singularity_ochem

N.B.! On aarch64 architecture run:
sudo singularity build ../env/ochemenv/ochemenv.sif singularity_ochem_arm

5) in build folder: compile code 

# Install correct version of java jdk (version 1.8);  maven for the later Java versions is incompatible

sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk
sudo apt install maven subversion zip git
cd ${ROOT_DIR}/build
./refresh_all

6) start servers

cd ${ROOT_DIR}/
bash startHostName.sh localhost

N.B.! On aarch64 architecture run:
bash armStartHostName.sh localhost

The OCHEM will be available at 

http://localhost:8080
http://localhost:7080/metaserver

If servers are not available (you will see them under the second link) after few minutes, start them manually
cd ${ROOT_DIR}/servers
./start.sh ochem

7) If you would like to change localhost to, e.g., your IP run

cd ${ROOT_DIR}/
bash startHostName.sh YOUR_IP

8) in server folder xemistry : install Xemistry tools for substructure search (see instructions in .
Download plugin and after that update mysql:

mysql -uroot -p < xemistry_init.sql

N.B:! Both ochemenv and servers reuse the same image, which is linked with "ln -s"
